        <h4># About Me</h4>
        <p>I am a Computer Engineering candidate at the University of Waterloo. I have an deep appreciation for novel ideas/technologies and try to ensure that my learning never stagnates. I have a wide variety of interests ranging from software development to music and current affairs.</p>
        <p>I have completed internships at organizations of various sizes, the most recent placement being a Toronto based startup. The majority of my responsibilities have been oriented towards web development using technologies across the stack.</p>
        <p>One skill that I pride myself on is the ability to empathize with a client/customer's needs and maintain a solid focus on the projects that I work on. Another important skill that I have cultivated in my past work experiences is the ability to communicate within a development team and to other departments/external clients. Opportunities that demonstrate these skills have manifested in the form of presentations to a company providing product updates on behalf of the development team. Another way has been through attending client meetings to gather business requirements and translating that information into technical specifications.</p>
        <p>As a TCK (Third Culture Kid), I have lived in a number of countries since birth, which has offered me a unique perspective of the world and what it means to be a global citizen.</p>

        <h4># Skills</h4>
        <p>I currently like to hack on python due to its simplicity. I am a proponent of using tools that allow you to focus on the problem you are trying to solve rather than semantics. I have also worked on past projects at school and in the workplace using <strong>C, C++, C#, Javascript and Java</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have an interest in data analysis/engineering and have dabbled with python data analysis tools in the past such as <strong>pandas, numpy and matplotlib</strong>. On the data engineering side, I am currently learning <strong>Hadoop</strong> and map-reduce principles.
        </p>
        <p>I have experience building out RESTful APIs using Flask.</p>

        <h4># Interests/Achievements</h4>
        <p>I am a passionate musician and  have played in countless bands over the past few years in various roles (Drummer, Guitarist, Bassist). My most memorable musical achievement was the opportunity to play for the JESS Music Festival in front of a crowd of 2500+ people which aimed to raise money to support orphanages in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>I have an interest in a variety of sports including Squash, MMA and Muay Thai.</p>
        <p>I have completed all three levels of the International Award (Bronze, Silver, Gold). This involved a 4 day trek in the Vietnamese forest.</p>
        <p>I've participated in a group mission trip to India lasting two weeks. The trip provided me with social perspectives on poverty and religious persecution.</p>
